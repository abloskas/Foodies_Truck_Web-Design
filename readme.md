Info about: The Foodies Truck (thefoodiestruck.com)

This repository contains a basic HTML5, CSS3 site with PHP contact form and integrated Google Maps API.
It also has wireframes and artboards.

None of the places, names, etc. are real, they are all made up for the purposes of a school project. 
This site was once hosted on the domain thefoodiestruck.com for viewing purposes but is now here on Github only.
